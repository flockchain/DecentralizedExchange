 Decentralized Exchange for Crypto Currencys

Back in the days, these code worked very well. The API has changed and my application sleeps now forever. But that's not the end. I am currently working with the new API on a much more complex application. When I finished I delete this repo and post the new one. The API I am using and had used for this, is the 1inch API provided by Moralis. Check out all Moralis Features and become a real Web3-Wizard.
